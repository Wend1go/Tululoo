The following conditions apply to JavaScript framework included

Short explanation:
 ~ You can sell your games that you've made with Tululoo
 ~ You can still sell your games if you've made them with framework without using IDE for one or other reason.
 ~ But do not just sell framework itself. Commercialize things that you've made, not things that help to make these.
 ~ Also do not build software of similar purposes as Tululoo on it's framework.
 ~ However you can fork and improve framework itself, if you'll keep license the same and mention previous authors. This includes building 'alternative' versions of framework for use with Tululoo or separately.
